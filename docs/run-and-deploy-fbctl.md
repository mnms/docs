!!! Note
    Command Line Interface(CLI) of LightningDB supports not only deploy and start command but also many commands to access and manipulate data in LightningDB.

# 1. How to run fbctl

## (1) Run

To run fbctl, ${FBPATH} should be set. If not, following error messages will be shown.

``` bash
To start using fbctl, you should set env FBPATH
ex)
export FBPATH=$HOME/.flashbase
```

!!! Tip
    In case of EC2 Instance, this path is set automatically.


Run **fbctl** by typing 'fbctl'

``` bash
$ fbctl
```

When fbctl starts at the first time, user needs to confirm 'base_directory'. 

[~/tsr2][^1] is default value.

``` bash
Type base directory of flashbase [~/tsr2]
~/tsr2
OK, ~/tsr2
```

In '${FBPATH}/.flashbase/config', user can modify 'base_directory'.

If user logs in fbctl normally, fbctl starts on last visited cluster.
In case of first login, '-' is shown instead of cluster number.


``` bash
root@flashbase:->

...
...

root@flashbase:1>
```

!!! Tip
    In this page, '$' means that user is in Centos and '>' means that user is in fbctl.


## (2) Log messages

Log messages of fbctl will be saved in '${FBPATH}/logs/fb-roate.log'.

Its max-file-size is 1GiB and **rolling update** will be done in case of exceed of size limit.


# 2. Deploy LightningDB

**Deploy** is the procedure that LightningDB is installed with the specified cluster number.

User could make LightningDB cluster with the following command.

``` bash
> deploy 1
```

After deploy command, user should type the following information that provides its last used value.

- installer
- host
- number of masters
- replicas
- number of ssd(disk)
- prefix of db path


Use below option not to save last used value.

``` bash
> deploy --history-save=False
```

## (1) Select installer

``` bash
Select installer

    [ INSTALLER LIST ]
    (1) flashbase.dev.master.dbcb9e.bin
    (2) flashbase.trial.master.dbcb9e-dirty.bin
    (3) flashbase.trial.master.dbcb9e.bin

Please enter the number, file path or url of the installer you want to use.
you can also add file in list by copy to '$FBPATH/releases/'
1
OK, flashbase.dev.master.dbcb9e.bin
```

With only URL, instead of file path, LightningDB can be installed like below. The downloaded file is stored under '${FBPATH}/releases/'

``` bash
https://flashbase.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/flashbase.dev.master.dbcb9e.bin 

Downloading flashbase.dev.master.dbcb9e.bin
[=======                                           ] 15%
```

If the list is empty like below, you can select the installer only by entering the file path or by entering url. To add an installer to the list, copy it under '${FBPATH}/releases/'

``` bash
Select installer

    [ INSTALLER LIST ]
    (empty)

Please enter file path or url of the installer you want to use
you can also add file in list by copy to '$FBPATH/releases/'
```

## (2) Type Hosts

IP address or hostname can be used. In case of several hosts, list can be seperated by comma(',').

``` bash
Please type host list separated by comma(,) [127.0.0.1]
nodeA, nodeB, nodeC, nodeD
OK, ['nodeA', 'nodeB', 'nodeC', 'nodeD']
```

## (3) Type Masters


``` bash
How many masters would you like to create on each host? [1]
1
OK, 1
Please type ports separate with comma(,) and use hyphen(-) for range. [18100]
18100
OK, ['18100']
```

Define how many master processes will be created in the cluster per server.

## (4) Type information of slave

``` bash
How many replicas would you like to create on each master? [2]
2
OK, 2
Please type ports separate with comma(,) and use hyphen(-) for range. [18150-18151]
18150-18151
OK, ['18150-18151']
```

Define how many slave processes will be created for a master process.



[^1]: If user types 'enter' without any text, the default value is applied. In some case, default value will not provided.

## (5) Type the count of SSD(disk) and the path of DB files

``` bash
How many ssd would you like to use? [3]
3
OK, 3

Type prefix of db path [~/sata_ssd/ssd_]
OK, ~/sata_ssd/ssd_

```

## (6) Check all settings finally
Finally all settings will be shown and confirmation will be requested like below.


``` bash
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| NAME            | VALUE                                       |

| slave ports     | 18150-18151                                 |
| ssd count       | 3                                           |
| db path         | ~/sata_ssd/ssd_                             |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
Do you want to proceed with the deploy accroding to the above information? (y/n)
y
```

## (7) Deploy cluster


After deploying is completed, following messages are shown and fbctl of the cluster is activated.

``` bash
Check status of hosts...
+-----------+--------+
| HOST      | STATUS |
+-----------+--------+
| nodeA     | OK     |
| nodeB     | OK     |

+-----------+--------+
| HOST      | STATUS |
+-----------+--------+
| nodeA     | CLEAN  |
| nodeB     | CLEAN  |
| nodeC     | CLEAN  |
| nodeD     | CLEAN  |
+-----------+--------+
OK
Transfer install and execute...
 - nodeA
 - nodeB
 - nodeC
 - nodeD
Sync conf...
Complete to deploy cluster 1
Cluster 1 selected.
```

When an error occurs during deploying, error messages will be shown like below.

**Host connection error**

``` bash
Check status of hosts...
+-------+------------------+
| HOST  | STATUS           |
+-------+------------------+
| nodeA | OK               |
| nodeB | SSH ERROR        |
| nodeC | UNKNOWN HOST     |
| nodeD | CONNECTION ERROR |
+-------+------------------+
There are unavailable host.
```


- SSH ERROR 
    - SSH access error. Please check SSH KEY exchange or the status of SSH client/server.
- UNKNOWN HOST
    - Can not get IP address with the hostname. Please check if the hostname is right.
- CONNECTION ERROR
    - Please check the status of host(server) or outbound/inbound of the server.


**Cluster already exist**

``` bash
Checking for cluster exist...
+-------+---------------+
| HOST  | STATUS        |
+-------+---------------+
| nodeA | CLEAN         |
| nodeB | CLEAN         |
| nodeC | CLUSTER EXIST |
| nodeD | CLUSTER EXIST |
+-------+---------------+
Cluster information exist on some hosts.
```

- CLUSTER EXIST
    - LightningDB is already deployed in the cluster of the host.


**Not include localhost**

``` bash
 Check status of hosts...
  +-------+------------------+
  | HOST  | STATUS           |
  +-------+------------------+
  | nodeB | OK               |

  +-------+------------------+
  Must include localhost.
```

If localhost(127.0.0.1) is not included in host information, this error occurs. Please add localhost in host list in this case.

From now, user can start and manage clusters of LightningDB with [Commands](command-line-interface.md).


# 3. LightningDB Version Update

In case of version update, 'deploy' command is used.

``` bash
> c 1 // alias of 'cluster use 1'
